# Forth source files

See the sample app in the `/myapp` folder.

There's a `chad.exe` in the `/bin` folder for your convenience.
Don't trust executables downloaded from the Internet except in a sandbox.
Chad is easy enough to compile, but if you're into pre-compiled apps do yourself
a favor and set up a VM or sandbox to limit their access to your PC.

You should compile from source, which is safer for you and could reveal bugs for me.

`myfont.bin` is generated by the `/utility/fonts` utility.
