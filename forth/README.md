# Forth source files

See the sample app in the `myapp` folder.

There's a `chad.exe` for your convenience, compiled by either Code::Blocks
or Visual Studio. Either version is in the 75KB range, but CB is a little smaller.

Don't trust executables downloaded from the Internet except in a sandbox.
Chad is easy enough to compile, but if you're into pre-compiled apps do yourself
a favor and set up a VM or sandbox to limit their access to your PC.

You should compile from source, which is safer for you and could reveal bugs for me.
