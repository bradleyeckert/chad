# Executables for Windows

You should compile these executables yourself, which isn't too hard,
rather than download them. But maybe you're lazy.
Hopefully not too lazy to use a sandbox or a VM.
If you're at a company, there are rules. Or at least there should be.

- **chad.exe** is the `chad` simulator and Forth environment.
- **gui.exe** is `chad` with a graphic window included.
- **term.exe** is a simple terminal emulator that you can run from the command line.
- **isp.exe** is an In System Programming utility that uses the UART and SPIF.

If you use Windows, try ConEmu as your (command line) terminal. It's wonderful.
The keyboard buffer makes it easy to scroll back to previous line inputs,
cut and paste, etc. It also displays UTF-8 and handles ANSI codes.
PowerShell also works.
