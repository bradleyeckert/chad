# Welcome to your new cult

Maybe it's time for something new.
Why not get real about what it means to be a computer programmer?
Like programming as a way of being, a creative download from the Universe.
Why isn't computer programming treated as a monastic calling?
Maybe that's where it all went wrong.
If you're up for it, you might consider...

- A monastic lifestyle, meaning:
- Celibacy, but including meditative practice.
- Living in a yoga center or other such conditioned space.
- You have to understand C well enough to see what `chad` does.

You are a blessing. A gift to God (or creation or universe or whathaveyou).
Each new day starts with you.
You create a feeling of gratitude and abundance.
It's like setting a pointer whose default setting is a kind of crappy
collective unconscious of the planet.
Nope, set that pointer every morning first thing after waking.
Take a long, deep breath, while thinking of how grateful you are to be alive
and how wonderful the possibilities of the new day are.
Upon exhaling, say "thank you". That's it.
Every morning, don't forget.
It affects your coding work greatly.
And your general attitude on life.

Perform a similar gratitude ritual upon sleeping so your brain can
do its best work while you sleep. Power naps can be great problem solvers.

If you're a coder, learn how to be a monk. Lots of resources on that.
Can't quite swing "living in a yoga center"?
You can consecrate your own space, but it will take some doing. 
The monastery guys (and gals) figured this out long ago.
Try the Isha foundation if you're secularly minded.

If you're looking for a cult leader, I'm probably not the guy.
I'm willing to learn from the legendary Charles H. Moore himself,
who didn't want to be one either. I only wrote `chad`.

If this is all just too much, stick with C.
You know, the language for writing operating systems.
Because computing had to pay the bills.
Because of that, libraries.
Because of that, it's not your code.
That's not a spiritual practice then, is it? It's business.

Which is fine, but why does everyone on the planet have an ARM processor
in their hands?
Because arms are offensive weapons.
How's everyone at each other's throats working for you?

How about waging peace?
How about we forget about ARM and its wannabes like RISC V?
They are all part of the same dying world.
It's rather poetic that Corona-virus could bring an empire built on C to its knees.
Sorry, C is not the language of peace.
It's the language of Commerce, which makes `C` such a fitting name.
If there's a mathematical function relating lines of code to body count,
the C language and its libraries wouldn't exactly come out clean.
Don't stop me, I'm on a roll.
An Admiral in the US Navy starting off this whole business had its time.
But here's the thing about planetary consciousness shifts.
You have to roll with the tide.
Stop coding for war machines.

If your code is so great, why shouldn't everyone on the planet be 
able to run it without it being hosted by
some military industrial complex derived CPU
accompanied by a ridiculously complex C tool-chain?
Building the silicon is a formality, the CPU can be simulated.
Which is fine. Did you build your code so sucky the time would matter?

No, let's get real. Let's get simple. Let's just build code.
