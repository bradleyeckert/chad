# Welcome to your new cult

Okay, maybe not a cult. A cult shuns you when you leave. Computer programming
is jokingly referred to as a religion. Well, it kind of is, but so is culture
in general. There's a whole groupthink that goes along with the shadows on the
wall of Plato's cave.

Intent matters. It's the seed of creation. Once the seed sprouts and grows, it's going to
remain the same tree. You can see this in company cultures.
Forth was designed for exploration. Exploration of space,
the solar system, the bottom of the ocean. The Voyager spacecraft, currently
beyond the solar system, was launched with Forth on-board.
If you are an explorer, Forth is for you.

Where did C come from?
It evolved out of Algol, which evolved out of the military computers.
An Admiral in the US Navy started this whole language business.
That zeitgeist led to everyone on the planet having an ARM processor
in their hands.
How about that? The entire world is ARMed. 
It's Admiral Hopper's intent writ large.
That's how intent works. The ripples keep on going.
How's everyone at each other's throats working for you?

How about waging peace?
How about we forget about ARM and its wannabes like RISC V?
Sorry, C is not the language of peace.
It's the language of commerce, or war without bullets as it's practiced.
But here's the thing about planetary consciousness shifts.
You have to roll with the tide.
Stop coding for war machines.

When the power of love overcomes the love of power, there will be peace.
The problem with publicly traded companies such as ARM is that they fall into
the latter group. This is why, even though FOSS tools may create extra work for you,
they are the most appropriate maker tools.
Why create the future out of the bones of a dying world when the power of love is right there?

I have to admit, I really like C. It has its problems, but it's very good.
It makes so much business sense to do serious applications in C.
But here's the problem: intentionality. 
What was the intention of the library authors?
You don't know where their minds were at.
Leveraging libraries willy nilly is a form of intentional promiscuity.
You don't want some dirty little piece of code polluting your project
because it has real effects.
There is a real ghost in the machine due to the way mind and matter interact.
So many consumer products are psychically an unholy mess.
Notice how your smartphone messes with your inner peace.
Let's do better.

If your code is so great, why shouldn't everyone on the planet be 
able to run it without it being hosted by
some military industrial complex derived CPU
accompanied by a ridiculously complex C tool-chain?
Building the silicon is a formality, the CPU can be simulated.
Which is fine. Did you build your code so sucky the time would matter?

No, let's get real. Let's get simple. Let's just build code.

The world is the way it is because we became disconnected from spirit.
We are spiritual beings. That's just how biology works,
with its integration with infinite timelessness.
Spiritual practices are sorely lacking in today's world.
Those practices don't have to be boring.
They are all about the flow mental state.
The flow state is a practice.
Programming is a very good practice.
Why not use a language that's built for it? 
Like Forth?

## Why Forth?

You can find plenty of web sites listing the technical reasons.
Forth is a very productive computer language, in the right hands.
It can produce very bad results when in the wrong hands.
If you are a moron, don't use Forth.
If you love programming and are reasonably bright, consider Forth.
It forces you to think in a more holistic way about problems.

FORTH Inc's experience with its Forth classes was that students
typically learned Forth in a week and became productive in a month.
The staffing experiences of companies using Open Firmware,
when it was a thing, didn't bear that out.
Being productive isn't the same as writing good code.
It takes a much longer time to master Forth.
The 10,000-hour rule probably applies here.
That's a serious investment.
What are you investing in?
Who will hire a Forth expert?
You are investing in you.
Your mind, your way of looking at the world, your sanity.

Running a Forth shop is a long-term investment in people.
You don't get the crutch of replaceable cogs.
You have to treat your employees like actual people, not day slaves.
You have to be able to find and nurture talent over the long term.
The use of Forth in large projects requires discipline on both the technical
and human sides.
A language that requires discipline to use is a tool for creating disciplined people. 
So, while coding large projects in Forth is seen as a foolhardy exercise by some,
that's because they are focused on the churn and burn business model or can't manage people.
Long-term investment in creativity is a different thing.
