COM ports on the PC

The Lattice Brevia2 shows up as two USB serial ports: COM3 and COM4. The latter is SPIF.
To see the COM ports on Windows, open Device Manager and click on Ports (COM & LPT).

`isp.c` works but isn't polished. It was tested with Code::Blocks on Windows.
Serial communications uses a cross-platform library that has a GPL license. Thanks, Teunis!
